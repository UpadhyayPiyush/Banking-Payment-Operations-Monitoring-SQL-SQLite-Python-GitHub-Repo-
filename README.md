# Banking Payment Operations Monitoring 

This project presents an end-to-end banking transaction monitoring and operational risk analytics system built using MySQL, SQL, Python, and Power BI.  
The system analyzes 120,000+ financial transactions across customers, accounts, login activity, and settlements to simulate a real payment operations environment.  
The dashboard enables operations teams to monitor system health, detect transaction backlogs, identify abnormal customer behavior, and evaluate settlement performance. The solution combines SQL-based operational KPIs, statistical anomaly detection in Python, and an interactive Power BI monitoring interface to support data-driven decision making.
